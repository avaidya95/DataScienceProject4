Battle of the Neighborhoods â€“ Hospital

This is an IBM Data Science Capstone Project provided by Coursera. Worked on a dataset
containing information about hospitals in India. Extracted data from a website to get
information about localities in Mumbai. Data cleaning, Data transformation, Data analysis
and Data Visualization were done on the dataset. Foursquare api was used to get Hospital data based on the locality. Hospitals were clustered together corresponding to the nearest locality using k means clustering algorithm. Folium was used to plot the results on the map.
